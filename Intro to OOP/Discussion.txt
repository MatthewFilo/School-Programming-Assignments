	In this file we had to use the concept of inheritance and polymorphism to design this database. We also had to design a driver file to be able to
fully test our code, inputting different monthly profits to be able to see how much money each of the employee's in the database made.

	One issue that I had was implementing the concept of inheritance into the base and derived classes. At first I was very confused on how to 
implement the concept, and struggled for a few hours on it. I overcame this by taking a small break, coming back to the program, and then reading
up on a few google guides on how the concept of inheritance works in C++ and exactly what the base and derived classes were. 

	Another issue I had was with the concept of polymorphism, but I find it funny looking back that I had such a hard time implementing polymorphism
within the calculate salary function as it was actually really easy! I kept implementing the function incorrectly in my employee.cpp file for the calculate 
salary function but once I made the function virtual in my employee.h file, it allowed me to have different return values based on the class
that the function was implemented into and being called by, thus fixing my problem by returning 0 to the function in the employee.cpp file
and making the function virtual in the employee.h file.

	Overall, this was a really fun assignment as I have not had much experience with OOP outside of python, so for me it was interesting to see
how it worked inside of C++. The assignment itself was fun and was one of my favorite assignments yet and I really enjoyed how we were able to
program with OOP as, from what I have heard, I heard it is used alot within programming interviews and real world applications, and after
programming this assignment and seeing the efficiency of OOP, I can understand why!
